NAME
    Acme::Sort::Schwartzian - a keyword that provides sort via a Schwartzian
    transform

SYNOPSIS
       use Acme::Sort::Schwarz sort_schwartz => { -as => 'ssort' };
   
       my @sorted = ssort { length($_) } <=> qw(foobar baz quux xyzzy);
   
       print "$_\n" for @sorted;
   
       __END__
       baz
       quux
       xyzzy
       foobar

DESCRIPTION
    This module is mostly just for me to play with Parse::Keyword. In
    particular, it's a study of deparsing a coderef captured by
    Parse::Keyword and recompiling that into a block of a larger function
    (along with any closed over variables). This is a technique that might
    be useful in the future for something like Sub::Quote.

    It provides the keyword "sort_schwartz", but because that's annoying to
    type out, you can rename it something else (as shown in the SYNOPSIS).

    It implements the Schwartzian transform - i.e. something like this:

       my @sorted =
          map  { $_->[0] }
          sort { $a->[1] cmp $b->[1] }
          map  { [ $_ => func($_) ] }
             @unsorted;

  Keyword
    "sort_schwartz { KEY_BLOCK } OPERATOR? LIST"
        The key block is a block of Perl code that when given a value (in
        $_) generates a key to sort by. In other words, it's the "func()" in
        the bottom "map" of the standard Schwatzian transform.

        The operator is one of "cmp" (lexicographic), "-cmp" (reverse
        lexicographic), "<=>" (numeric) or "-<=>" (reverse numeric). If
        omitted, defaults to "cmp".

        The list is the list of items to be sorted.

LIMITATIONS
    *   This module's acronym is ASS.
